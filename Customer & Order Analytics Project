AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?;
 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE product = 'iPhone' 
and length (orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February;

SELECT distinct customers.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length (orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?;

SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?;

SELECT SUM(quantity) as Quantity, product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, 
and what was the average amount spent for those customers?;
 
SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum) AS quantity_customers, avg(quantity*price) AS average
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
